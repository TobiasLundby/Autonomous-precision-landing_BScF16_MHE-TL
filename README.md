# Location and Orientation Control of Drones to facilitate Precision Landing
*Bachelor's Thesis for Robot Systems at SDU by Mathias HÃ¸jgaard & Tobias Lundby*

The desire is to develop a software interface with a controller such that the drone can be controlled at lower level than the controller initially allows. The added control should make the drone capable of landing autonomously positioned in a certain direction/orientation within a radius of 0.20 m on a landing platform with a wind speed of maximum 5 m/s in a random direction. The interface must, if necessary, override some of the basic controller functionality by controlling the hardware at a lower level and thus bypass preset instruction and values, etc. Thus manual control from a computer should also be possible. Two or more controllers may be tested to determine advantages and disadvantages of these in relation to fulfillment of the goal.
